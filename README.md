## Proof of Concept of a Smart DAQ Device able to Upload Live Experimental Sensor Data to a Data Repository with a Unique Data Fingerprint

This paper discusses an innovative proof-of-concept method for management of collected experimental data in real-time and compatible with any open environment. The proposed proof-of-concept smart DAQ device has the minimum hardware caracteristics to handle data measurements collection from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely on a Dataverse. 

This paper is currently being written, in an open enviroment format. Available as a prePrint draft document at Elsevier's SSRN platform.

## Proof of Concept

To test and validate proposed smart DAQ PCB electronics and its firmware as a solution for LIVE experimental data measurements on any test specimen part of a experimental campaign, This PCB electronis are being used to measure a predifiend sent of variables/parameters to further study several asphalt mixtures with knonn carbon fibers weight content in the asphalt matrix. Below is a YouTube link to an undeited short video showing one of the experimental setups.
