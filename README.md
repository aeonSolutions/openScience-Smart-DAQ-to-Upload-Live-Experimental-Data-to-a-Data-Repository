## A Smart DAQ Device able to Upload Live Experimental Sensor Data to a Data Repository with a Unique Data Fingerprint ID

This Sci. research presents an innovative method for experimental data acquisition and management of collected data in real-time and is compatible with any open environment. The proposed smart DAQ device prototype has the minimum hardware characteristics to handle data measurements collected from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file, and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely on a Dataverse.

These Smart DAQ devices are of type "Internet of Everything" (IoE) Smart Devices and are able to connect with each other using swarm intelligence. The main purpose is to increase data integrity and trustworthiness among DAQ devices connected and on all experimental data collected during an experiment or research project.

</p>

Experimental data collected is stored in a block format, meaning, a single block stores an individual piece of experimental data written to it, the hash of the previous block, and its own hash.

</p>

This is the main principle of operation behind blockchain technologies, to make it really difficult to modify experimental data once itâ€™s written to a block since hashes are interconnected among each other since the beginning of an experiment, experimental campaign, and even since the beginning of a research project. Every block written references the hash of its previous block. This way, for any modification to the data stored in a block, the hash it stores changes forcing the following blocks to also indicate a change (since they must have the hash of the previous block). To modify a block is needed a rewrite on all blocks.

</p>

**In everyday science at a labortory these Smart DAQ devices are able to connect among each other, in a swarm-like manner, and when doing so, increase experimental data trustworthiness and authenticity in an experiment part of a research project or experimental campaign.** Setting up a Swarm network of smart DAQ devices not only increases the quality of research results, by tagging each individual piece of experimental data collected from each individual sensor, with a unique data fingerprint ID (hash) at the exact same moment of data collection, broadcast it to other nearby smart DAQ devices and finally do data upload to a repository where a new, additional data fingerprint is added to existing ones (generated locally). This way is maintained and guaranteed data collection integrity locally, from the laboratory, until the moment is received and stored in a data repository in a cloud server.     

A paper is currently being written, in an open-environment format. Available as a preprint draft document at Elsevier's SSRN platform. https://ssrn.com/abstract=4210504 . See the [WIKI](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/openScienceResearch-Smart-DAQ-Device-able-to-Upload-Live-Experimental-Sensor-Data-to-a-Data-Repo/wiki) for how this kind of smart electronics can be connected for fail-safe data and redundancy (and as an IoE DAQ device) on any experimental setup.

<br>

**Most recent update**

The LDAD is officially up and running! Well, the very first release candidate of the firmware. Now, on this code revision, electrical resistance and measurement voltage are correctly measured by the built-in multimeter. And this means the smart DAQ is now ready to be installed on all specimens in an experimental campaign after configuration with the correct calibration curves (temperature compensated). From now on all changes will be towards improving usability and user experience in a laboratory.

The C firmware code now includes SRAM support for temporary storage of measured data in RAM up to 9175 samplings (for the 64Mbit IC) before flushing it into the onboard Flash storage. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75004548/multidimensional-char-string-array-initialization-and-usage-for-esp32-mcus-with/75004549#75004549) stack overflow question for more info. The [1.69" Display](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DklsWrB) is now also available and a standard layout design and configuration are now shown when the smart DAQ is powered.

A new PCB design layout made to fit a well-known [waterproof acrylic enclosure](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dmudkjt), is available with new DAQ capabilities. This new PCB design dimension is the one selected to move forward on this sci. research project. See the photos below.

<br>

**Status**

This project is waiting for parts to arrive from aliExpress and for fabrication of a revised PCB electronics from factory. Will resume at the end of February 2023. In 3/4 weeks time.

## Proof of Concept

To test and validate proposed smart DAQ PCB electronics and its firmware as a solution for LIVE experimental data measurements on any test specimen part of a experimental campaign, This PCB electronics is being used to measure a predefined set of variables/parameters to further study several asphalt mixtures with known carbon fiber weight content in the asphalt matrix. Below is a YouTube link to an unedited short video showing one of the experimental setups.
