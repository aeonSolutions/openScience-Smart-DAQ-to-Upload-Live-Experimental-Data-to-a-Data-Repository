## Proof of Concept of a Smart DAQ Device able to Upload Live Experimental Sensor Data to a Data Repository with a Unique Data Fingerprint

This paper discusses an innovative proof-of-concept method for management of collected experimental data in real-time and compatible with any open environment. The proposed proof-of-concept smart DAQ device has the minimum hardware caracteristics to handle data measurements collection from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely on a Dataverse.
